# 💸 Schedule I: Cash-Only Illegal Deliveries Mod

This mod fixes a gameplay inconsistency in the game **Schedule I** where illegal shops accessed via the in-game delivery app would incorrectly charge your **bank account** instead of requiring **cash**, as they do in person.

With this mod, **all illegal transactions** now correctly **require cash only**, regardless of whether you're shopping in person or via the delivery app.

## 🗨️ Why This Mod?

In the base game, illegal items are meant to be bought with **untraceable cash**, maintaining realism and gameplay balance. However, a loophole allowed players to use **bank accounts** through the delivery app to buy illegal goods. This mod closes that loophole and restores consistency.
